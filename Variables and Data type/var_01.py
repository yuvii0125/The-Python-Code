# python have total 5 data types

#Python automatically identifies the data type of the variable you do not need to declare it.

#variable have 2 scopes global and local
#global scope is available inside and outside the function
# local scope is available only inside the function
#global scope is declared with the global keyword
#local scope is declared with the local keyword



#type() function returns the type of the variable

a = 5
b = 5.0
c = None
d = True
e = "Hello World"
#complex number 
f = 3 + 4j
print(f)
print(type(f))

print(a, b, c, d, e)
print(type(a), type(b), type(c), type(d), type(e))
