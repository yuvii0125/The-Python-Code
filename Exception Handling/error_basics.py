#There are 2 stages in code where error can occur
# 1. Syntax error (During Compilation)
# 2. Runtime error (During Execution)

#Syntax Error
#Something in the program is not written according to the program grammer
#Error is raised by the compiler / interpreter
#You can solve it by removing the error

#Examples of syntax errors
#1. Missing colon
#2. Missing semicolon
#3. Missing parenthesis
#4. Missing comma
#5. Missing indentation
#6. Misspelling a keyword
#7, Empty if/else/loops/class/function block
