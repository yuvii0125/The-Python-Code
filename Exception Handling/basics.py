#Error Handling :
# 1. avoid shutting down the complete code
# 2. We should deal error gracefully

# There are 2 types of errors
# 1. Syntax error : -> During Compilation
# 2. Execution error / Runtime errors  : -> During Execution


# Execution Error : 
# It doesn't prevent program from running but cause it to crash it it not handled properly 
# -> raised by python everyTime
